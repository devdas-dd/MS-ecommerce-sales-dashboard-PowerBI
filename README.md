Power BI project, centered around an MS E-commerce Sales Dashboard. 🛒💼 This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into the world of data and leverage the power of visualization to gain valuable insights into our sales data.

📆 I've developed a dynamic dashboard that allows us to analyze sales trends on a monthly and quarterly basis, giving us the ability to spot key patterns and make data-driven decisions. 📊✨

🌍 Moreover, we've added a location-based analysis feature, helping us understand sales performance across different regions and markets. 🗺️
